# Deloitte Data Analytics Job Simulation Project

This repository contains the project files and deliverables from the **Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program** hosted on Forage. The project simulates a real-world scenario involving data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to assist a client in making data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview

The objective was to analyze client sales data, identify trends and outliers, and provide strategic insights to improve business performance. The project was completed using Python (Jupyter Notebooks) and Excel-based datasets, simulating tasks a junior data analyst might face in a professional consulting environment.

## Files Included

- `real_delloitte_project.ipynb`: Initial data exploration and preprocessing
- `task3.ipynb`: Predictive modeling and out-of-sample predictions
- `task4.ipynb`: Final outputs and business insights summary
- `clean_data_after_eda.xls`: Cleaned dataset after preprocessing
- `price_data.xls`: Product pricing information used in analysis
- `data_for_predictions.xls`: Dataset used to generate predictions
- `out_of_sample_data_with_predictions.xls`: Final predictions and performance evaluation

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Predictive Modeling (Regression/Forecasting)
- Use of Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn
- Business Insight Communication

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the notebooks in a Jupyter environment
3. Follow the step-by-step analysis and modeling process
4. Review insights and predictions generated for strategic decision-making

## Outcome

This simulation provided hands-on experience in a consulting-style data analytics engagement, enhancing practical skills in:
- Identifying client problems
- Deriving data-driven insights
- Communicating findings effectively to stakeholders
